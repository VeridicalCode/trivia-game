# Trek Trivia

## What Is This Thing?
Exactly what it says on the box: an online Star Trek-themed trivia game.

## What's Special About It?
The game is timed, bar-style, giving the player a limited window in which to answer the question correctly or lose any potential points. A simple constructor function that randomizes the order of the correct responses makes it as easy as possible to expand the game with new questions or a different theme, with minimal mental load for the programmer.

## How Do I Use It?
When a question pops up, choose your response by clicking on the answer you wish to submit. After each question, the game will display whether you were correct, the right answer if you weren't correct, and your current score, then automatically advance to the next question. Keep an eye on the timer!

## Who Made It?
All local code was written solely by myself, Mars Getsoian. JQuery, Moment.js, and Bootstrap are the product of their respective communities, and the game concept is courtesy of Trinity.

## Are There Bugs?
There are no known bugs. Question responses will be modifed visually to make the intended interaction (clicking on them) more clear in future updates.
