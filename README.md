# trivia-game

This timed game gives the player a brief window to answer each of a series of trivia questions, reporting failures and successes after each guess and at the end of the game. A countdown is provided to let the player know how much time remains, and the order of possible answers is randomized with each playthrough. The game can be easily expanded with additional questions or altered in theme courtesy of a simple constructor function.
